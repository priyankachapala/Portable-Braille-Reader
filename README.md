# Portable Braille Reader

This project is designed to help visually challenged people. The user can access any digitalsied version of the book using Bluetooth. To implement this device follow the given steps.

Components Recquired
1.Microcontroller__
2.Hc-05 Bluetooth Module__
3.6-Driver circuits for linear push pull actuators__
4.6-push pull solenoids__
    Microcontroller should be choosen carefully as there will be many memory limitations, delays and code compatibilty with various microcntrollers. However, I have used PIC16F877A which has a Flash Memory of 14.3KB (sufficient for my code).

Strategy to develop the system
1. Study the microcntroller__
2.Interfacing the microcontroller with bluetooth module__
3.Algorithm to convert single alphabet to Braille text__
4.design and test solenoid driver circuit__
